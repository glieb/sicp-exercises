This is a collection of exercise solutions from the second edition
of Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs.

The goal of this repository is to enhance my own understanding of the
SICP book. I am choosing to share it for the benefit of anyone else
reading the book or otherwise curious. My own philosophy when
completing these exercises was to provide the best possible answer
to each question I attempted, even if the methods used would have
been considered "cheating" in an academic setting.

Credit goes to the Community Scheme Wiki for being the primary source
against which I checked my work and from which I copied code snippets
when they were inarguably superior to my own. Due to extensive reliance
on the Community Scheme Wiki for completing and perfecting these
solutions, the entire repo can be considered a derivative work of that
wiki, which you can find at http://community.schemewiki.org/.

Any code written here can be assumed to at minimum have been compared
to similar code snippets written elsewhere, and at maximum have been 
copied entirely. Any comments written here describing the code or
otherwise using plain English can be assumed to have been written
entirely by me. However, to avoid unnecessary complications, the whole 
work is covered under one license.

The solution files are all given a .scm extension for the purpose of
syntax highlighting. A large portion of them will cause errors if
you attempt to run them through an interpreter. The files with "test"
in the name can all be loaded into MIT Scheme without errors, as well
as a few without.
