This is a collection of exercise solutions from the second edition
of Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman's Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs.

In an attempt to produce as accurate and complete an answer to each
exercise in the book, each answer was researched online as well as
tested in the MIT Scheme interpreter whenever the need became
apparent. While I did spend ample time inventing my own creative
solutions to many of these problems, all of them involved at least
some degree of verification against the existing record of solutions.
Therefore, none of what is written here should be considered entirely
my own creation. 

The solution files are all given a .scm extension for the purpose of
syntax highlighting. A large portion of them will cause errors if
you attempt to run them through an interpreter. The files with "test"
in the name can all be loaded into MIT Scheme without errors, as well
as a few without.
